# 1-Alert
1-Alert is a mobile application which is currently supported by the Android OS. This application in conjunction with the analytical model has been developed as a part of my thesis project during my post graduation in Business Analytics. 

Factors such as rise in need for safety and security solutions, owing to increase in natural calamities because of climate change & terrorist attacks, implementation of regulatory policies for public safety, and necessity of emergency preparedness are providing impetus for the growth of the global disaster and emergency management market. During disasters in particular, the situation is chaotic and disorganized. In the absence of ground-level information about the victims stranded in such disasters, the responding authorities often mobilize the resources based on intuition. As a result of this, the already limited resources are sometimes wasted or they do not reach the victim who is in a critical need of them. Different authorities like fire departments, hospitals, security and police forces etc. work in distinct jurisdiction and out of synchronization.

As a panacea to all these difficulties arising out of emergency and disaster situtations, 1-Alert application provides a one-stop solution using which the victims can generate SOS alerts during times of distress. These alerts would be raised and displayed on the admin panel of the application and the respective authorities would be engaged. Going a step further, the application resorts to use of machine learning algorithms to assign priorities to the victims based on circumstantial data which is collected via the 1-Alert application.

As a result of the application and it's predictive model, the authorities would work under a single umbrella and can make an optimal use of their resources, thus reducing human and financial losses.

The 1-Alert mobile application has been developed using Java in Android Studio. 

The admin panel is developed using PHP framework. The help requests raised can be viewed in the admin panel and can be extracted in CSV format, which can be fed to the analytical model.

R programming langauge has been used for building the machine learning models. 5 distinct machine learning algorithms have been used which are:
1. Decision Tree Classification
2. Decision Tree Classification using C5
3. Random Forest Classification
4. Naive Bayes Classification
5. Kernel SVM

The 5 models are then tested and the results were evaulated and compared against each other and the best performing model was used for making the final predictions on the live data.
